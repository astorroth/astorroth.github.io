                            I showcased my documentary and music as part of my school's annual show, the HFBK Jahresausstellung. The aim of the performance was to show the documentary in a time based media installation format that would give the viewer the possibility to opt in and out. The songs from my albums, that were part of the soundtrack of the documentary, were live performed by myself in sync with the video. For the duration of the performance aLIWONDYY was standing in a large display case made of glass, the object covered in silver foil. The documentary was projected onto the floor in front of the silver box and the inside of it (video and sound) was live streamed into the exhibition space.

                            In „Red Herrings, Angels and Clones" a creature with multiple bodies living in a utopian place called „the Zone", is following their friend to the „outside world". To become visible to this „outside world" and cross over they must undergo an operation that makes one body out of their multiple bodies. Using motifs from the <i>Little Mermaid</i>, <i>Stalker</i>, the piece is questioning how we became to desire (queer) identity, how the nonconforming body can be a place of resistance, and how we still fall for the trap of neoliberal identity politics, capitalizing our own precious identity.

                            „Grillade Grande 666" is set on a devilish barbecue party from which nobody is able to leave. Attending this party is a group of mermaids, goth kids, terrorists, and a band that seems to be right hand to the unspoken queen of the event, Grace. While Grace is in control of everything, and connected even to the devil himself, everyone else seems to stick to their peer group and is not able or willing to address or understand the others. That is until mermaid Shelly and terrorist Spiky fall in love. Believing that within their love lies salvation, Shelly and Spiky think that they found a way to leave the grill party. During the time of their escape, Grace is already installing a cult around their love, and when they inevitably arrive back at the Party their love is already common good.

                            „Aliwondy Is Arriving" is a documentary hat I filmed in Washington State, USA, shortly before the start of Covid. Filming this documentary laid the foundation for the development of aLIWONDYY. The idea behind the documentary was to observe my position as the person filming, and my experience and alienation as a stranger in the US. I tried to find ways to enhance that feeling of alienation by becoming completaly alien, aLIWONDYY, an alien prince. The creation of aLIWONDY coincides with my own transformation as a trans person and creating this role involved among other things the assemblage of a specific wardrobe. By becoming aLIWONDYY I attempted to confront myself with the violence of my gaze, to perhaps separate myself from it, to estrange myself from it, despite the impossibility of ever getting away from it.
